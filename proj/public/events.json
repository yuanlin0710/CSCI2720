Caroline Shaw is a distinctive voice in American music, and has received a Pulitzer Prize in Music and several Grammy awards. This work, Microfictions, was co-commissioned by Premiere Performances (with the support of Interlude.hk), together with the La Jolla Music Society, Carnegie Hall, Chamber Music Houston and the Shriver Hall Concert Series, and was dedicated to the Miró Quartet themselves. The work is a stimulating set of six short musical stories in the tradition of imagist poetry and the surrealist painting of Joan Miró. \n\nThis concert will also feature two beloved masterpieces for strings: the invigorating Mozart’s String Quintet in G minor (with violist Masumi Per Rostad) and the magnificent Brahms Quartet No. 1.",
