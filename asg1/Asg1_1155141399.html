                    <p>
                        Paabo was born in Stockholm, Sweden, in 1955 and grew up there with his mother, Estonian chemist Karin Paabo, 
                        who had escaped from the Soviet invasion in 1944 and arrived in Sweden as a refugee during World War II.
                        He was born through a extramarital affair of his father, Swedish biochemist Sune Bergstrom (1916-2004), who, like his son, 
                        became a recipient of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine (in 1982). 
                        <br>
                        Paabo grew up as a native Swedish speaker. In a 2012 interview with the Estonian newspaper Eesti Päevaleht, 
                        he said that he self-identifies as a Swede, but has a "special relationship with Estonia".

                    <h3>Education</h3>
                    <p> In 1975, Paabo began studying at Uppsala University, serving one year in the Swedish Defense Forces 
                        attached to the School of Interpreters. Paabo earned his Ph.D. from Uppsala University in 1986 for 
                        research investigating how the E19 protein of adenoviruses modulates the immune system.

                    <h3>Paabo and Neanderthal</h3>
                    <p>
                        In May 2010, Paabo and his colleagues published a draft sequence of the Neanderthal genome 
                        in the journal Science. He and his team also concluded that there was probably interbreeding 
                        between Neanderthals and Eurasian (but not Sub-Saharan African) humans. There is general 
                        mainstream support in the scientific community for this theory of interbreeding between 
                        archaic and modern humans. This admixture of modern human and Neanderthal genes is estimated 
                        to have occurred roughly between 50,000 and 60,000 years ago, in the Middle East.
                        <br>
                        In 2014, he published the book Neanderthal Man: In Search of Lost Genomes where he, in the mixed 
                        form of a memoir and popular science, tells the story of the research effort to map the 
                        Neanderthal genome combined with his thoughts on human evolution.

                    <h2>Research</h2>
                    <p>Humanity has always been intrigued by its origins. Where do we come from, 
                        and how are we related to those who came before us? What makes us, Homo sapiens, different from other hominins?
                        <br>

                        Through his pioneering research, Svante Paabo accomplished something seemingly impossible: 
                        sequencing the genome of the Neanderthal, an extinct relative of present-day humans. 
                        He also made the sensational discovery of a previously unknown hominin, Denisova. 
                        Importantly, Paabo also found that gene transfer had occurred from these now extinct hominins 
                        to Homo sapiens following the migration out of Africa around 70,000 years ago. This ancient 
                        flow of genes to present-day humans has physiological relevance today, for example affecting 
                        how our immune system reacts to infections.
                        <br>
                        
                        Paabo's seminal research gave rise to an entirely new scientific discipline; paleogenomics. 
                        By revealing genetic differences that distinguish all living humans from extinct hominins, 
                        his discoveries provide the basis for exploring what makes us uniquely human.</p>

                    <p class="changefont2S" style="color: rgb(0, 31, 110)">The 2022 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded on October 3 to geneticist Svante Paabo for his groundbreaking discoveries about human evolution and the genomes of extinct hominins.
        
                        Dr. Paabo is director of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany. His decades of research made it possible to extract 
                        and sequence a complete Neanderthal genome from bone fragments that were more than 40,000 years old, a task described by the Nobel Committee as “seemingly 
                        impossible.” Paabo also made the sensational discovery of a previously unknown hominin group, the Denisovans. Importantly, Paabo found that gene transfer 
                        had occurred from both of these extinct hominin groups to Homo sapiens following the migration out of Africa. This ancient flow of genes to present-day 
                        humans has physiological relevance today, for example affecting how our immune system reacts to infections.
                        
                        Paabo’s foundational research gave rise to an entirely new scientific discipline; paleogenomics. By revealing genetic differences that distinguish all 
                        living humans from extinct hominins, his discoveries provide a method for exploring what makes us uniquely human.
                        
                        “Paleogenomics has changed the study of human origins, because it allows us to look directly at the genome to infer relationships and assess population 
                        history,” said Anne Stone, Regents’ Professor in the School of Human Evolution and Social Change at Arizona State University and member of The Leakey 
                        Foundation’s Scientific Executive Committee.
                        
                        Fossils and morphology tell very important parts of the story of human evolution, but paleogenomic techniques have given scientists a new way to address 
                        important questions about humanity’s origins, including where we came from, why some species went extinct, and what makes us uniquely human.
                        
                        Stone said, “The genomic analyses of archaic humans allowed Svante Paabo and his collaborators to unexpectedly discover ‘Denisovans’ and reveal the 
                        complexity of interactions among populations in the Pleistocene. This work also allows us to examine the bits of archaic ancestry that are found in our 
                        genomes today. Svante has been at the forefront of ancient DNA research since the beginning and his lab really pushed the field forward both in terms 
                        of methodological development and the questions that he has asked. This prize is a terrific honor that is richly deserved.”</p>
